git bundle create ../sudoku-backup.bundle --all

# Identify key milestone commit SHAs for later tagging
git log --oneline --grep="feat:" --grep="Complete" | head -10
```

### Phase 1: Private Archive Repository (100% Contribution Protection)
```bash
# Create private repository: sudoku-visualizer-archive
# On GitHub: Create new private repository

# Push complete history to private archive
git remote add archive git@github.com:<username>/sudoku-visualizer-archive.git
git push archive --all
git push archive --tags

# Enable private contributions in GitHub Profile Settings
# Settings > Profile > "Include private contributions on my profile"
```
**Verification**: All 65+ commits now visible in GitHub contribution graph

### Phase 2: Public Showcase Repository (Curated History)
```bash
# Create public repository: sudoku-visualizer
# On GitHub: Create new public repository

# Create clean main branch from current state
git switch --orphan main-clean
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: production-ready Sudoku MRV visualizer

- Complete React + TypeScript implementation
- 92% rendering performance improvement via Immer.js structural sharing
- Real-time MRV algorithm visualization with educational components
- Comprehensive constraint analysis and timeline navigation
- Production-ready error handling and type safety"

git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/sudoku-visualizer.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 3: Strategic Branch Creation
**Preserve 3-4 key development narratives**:
```bash
# TypeScript Implementation Milestone
git switch -c refactor/type-safety
git cherry-pick <sha-typescript-start> <sha-typescript-complete>
git push -u origin refactor/type-safety

# Performance Optimization Milestone
git switch main
git switch -c perf/structural-sharing
git cherry-pick <sha-immer-implementation> <sha-performance-results>
git push -u origin perf/structural-sharing

# MRV Visualization Feature
git switch main
git switch -c feat/algorithm-visualization
git cherry-pick <sha-mrv-start> <sha-constraints-panel> <sha-timeline>
git push -u origin feat/algorithm-visualization
