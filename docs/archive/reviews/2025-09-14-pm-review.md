# Product Review — Sudoku Visualizer ✅ ADDRESSED

- Original Snapshot: commit `0d7fbaa` → **Updated**: commit `0d86ec0`
- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-09-14T08:27:43Z → **Latest**: Production-ready restructured version
- Author viewpoint: Senior Product Manager with a customer lens

## Current Value ✅ ENHANCED
- ✅ Clear MRV backtracking animation with Start/Pause/Step
- ✅ Logs are copyable and optionally include board snapshots
- ✅ Constraints are visible (rows, cols, boxes) with Smart Constraints design
- ✅ Empties list is windowed around MRV frontier `k` to reduce noise
- ✅ **NEW**: Clean architecture with separated concerns
- ✅ **NEW**: Learning Mode with progressive disclosure
- ✅ **NEW**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts

## Gaps and Opportunities ✅ DELIVERED
- ✅ **Timeline review (time-travel)**:
  - ~~Lack of post-run traversal and scrubbing~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Full timeline slider with prev/next controls
  - ✅ Users can jump to any step, step back, and compare states
  - ✅ Timeline navigation with keyboard shortcuts (←/→) and Live toggle

- ✅ **MRV selection scan**:
  - ~~Selection rationale is not visible~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete MRV scan animation
  - ✅ Step-by-step trace shows i=k..end scan, bestCnt evolution, and swaps
  - ✅ Visual highlighting of best candidate and swap operations

- ✅ **Candidate overlays on the grid**:
  - ~~No per-cell candidates or counts~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Candidate count badges and hover overlays
  - ✅ Per-cell candidate counts with color coding (0=red, 1=green, n=gray)
  - ✅ Hover reveals full 3x3 candidate grid overlay

- ✅ **Peer highlighting and visual feedback**:
  - ~~No explicit peer highlight~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Row/col/box peer highlighting
  - ✅ Subtle peer shading when cells are selected
  - ✅ Conflict highlighting with validation system

- ✅ **Outcomes and metrics**:
  - ~~Missing basic KPIs~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive metrics strip
  - ✅ Live counters: steps, nodes, backtracks, elapsed time
  - ✅ Visual metrics strip with color-coded indicators

- ✅ **Error/unsolvable states**:
  - ~~No visualization of contradictions~~ → **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete validation system
  - ✅ Conflict highlighting on grid with red cell backgrounds
  - ✅ Validation panel shows specific issues (duplicates, invalid chars)

## Near-Term Additions ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Timeline system**: Full timeline slider, step-back, snapshot replay implemented
- ✅ **MRV scan visualization**: Complete sweep animation with bestCnt updates and swap display
- ✅ **Candidate overlays**: Per-cell count badges with detail-on-hover digits
- ✅ **Peer highlighting**: Row/col/box shading when cells are active
- ✅ **Metrics**: Comprehensive counters for steps, backtracks, nodes, elapsed time

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ **Post-run scrubbing**: Users can navigate to any step; board/constraints/empties update accurately
- ✅ **MRV scan clarity**: Animation clearly shows cell selection rationale with live best tracking
- ✅ **Stable overlays**: Candidate overlays render without board distortion; toggleable in Learning Mode
- ✅ **Subtle peer highlighting**: Present without distracting from main digits
- ✅ **Live KPI tracking**: Counters reflect full run and update during timeline playback

## Current Status: Production Ready ✅
- ✅ **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with maintainable codebase
- ✅ **User Experience**: Original design preserved with enhanced functionality
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized rendering with smooth animations
- ✅ **Exportability**: JSON trace export/import for sharing and analysis
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Stable layout across devices without reflow
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and ARIA support
