## Goal ✅ ACHIEVED
Build an interactive visualization for LeetCode "Sudoku Solver" (backtracking) that demonstrates MRV (minimum remaining values) strategy and internal constraints in real time.

## Requirements ✅ COMPLETED
- **Input** ✅
  - ✅ Accept a 9×9 board via paste (9 lines, `.` for empty)
  - ✅ Multiple sample puzzles available by default (Classic, Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Visualization** ✅
  - ✅ Board grid animates solver events: selectCell, tryDigit, place, backtrack, solved
  - ✅ Smart Constraints panel:
    - ✅ Overview: contextual constraints for selected cell (row/col/box counts) + global stats
    - ✅ Detailed: stacked Rows/Cols/Boxes with digit chips and completion indicators
  - ✅ Empties (MRV order): windowed view around frontier `k` with candidate counts
  - ✅ MRV Status: selected cell and candidate digits as chips; "None" when pruned
  - ✅ Logs: step log with optional board snapshots, copy/clear controls
- **Controls** ✅
  - ✅ Start/Pause, Reset, Restart with speed slider and live ms display
  - ✅ Timeline: slider + Prev/Next + Live toggle for step review
  - ✅ Learning Mode: toggle advanced panels visibility
  - ✅ Keyboard shortcuts: Space (start/pause), Arrow keys (timeline), Esc (live)
- **Behavior** ✅
  - ✅ Stable layout with fixed board width
  - ✅ Robust generator lifecycle with safe state management
  - ✅ Original UI design preserved during restructuring
- **Performance** ✅
  - ✅ Smooth animation at 50–1000ms/step (configurable)
  - ✅ Optimized re-renders with proper hook separation

## Technical Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Stack**: React + Vite (TS), Tailwind CSS, clean development setup
- **Solver**: Pure MRV + backtracking generator in `src/lib/sudoku/solver.ts` with typed step events
- **Architecture**: Separated concerns with dedicated modules:
  - `src/lib/sudoku/`: Pure business logic (board.ts, solver.ts, validation.ts)
  - `src/hooks/`: State management (useSolverState, useVisualization, useSudokuController)
  - `src/components/`: UI components (SudokuVisualizer, BoardView, ConstraintsPanel, etc.)
  - `src/types/sudoku.ts`: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **State Management**: Hook-based architecture with proper lifecycle management

## Current Features ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Visual MRV scan animation** with step-by-step trace
- ✅ **Per-cell candidate overlays** and peer highlighting
- ✅ **Export/import step trace** (JSON format)
- ✅ **Learning mode** with collapsible advanced panels
- ✅ **Keyboard shortcuts** for efficient interaction
- ✅ **Multiple sample puzzles** with difficulty levels
- ✅ **Validation system** with conflict highlighting
- ✅ **Timeline navigation** with history playback

## Future Enhancements (potential)
- Unit tests with Vitest + React Testing Library
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Performance optimizations with bit masks
- Advanced constraint propagation techniques
